# TODO: write a function titled, divisibility() that...
#       receives two numbers (numerator & denominator)
#       determines whether they divide evenly or not
#       throws a TypeError if input cannot be converted to a number & returns 'error'
#       throws a ZeroDivisionError if denominator is 0 & returns 'error'
#       returns one of the following strings: 'divides evenly', 'doesn't divide evenly', or 'error'
